# Basic Example
This is a basic implementation of how the task scheduler using a [Semaphore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semaphore_(programming)) as the shared resource. The task scheduler is used to manage the number of concurrent tasks that can be executed at any given time. The number of concurrent tasks is limited by the number of available resources. In this example, the number of available resources is set to 2, so only 2 tasks can be executed concurrently. The tasks are executed in the order they are added to the task scheduler. The task scheduler is implemented using a [FIFO queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics)).
